You can easily build remark yourself in only a few, simple steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnab/remark.git
cd remark
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm install
node make
```

For this to work, you need to have installed the following software:
  * [`git`](http://git-scm.com/)
  * [`node`](http://nodejs.org/) (and `npm`, which is included in recent node versions)
