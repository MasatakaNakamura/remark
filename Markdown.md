A Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser:

```
# Slide 1
This is slide 1

---

# Slide 2
This is slide 2
```

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:

* A line containing three dashes constitutes a new slide (not a horizontal rule, `<hr />`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website]((http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're not familiar with Markdown formatting.
